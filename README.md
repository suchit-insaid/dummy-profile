- We saw how we can avoid using correlated values and why it is important not to use those while modelling. 
- We used Random forest and learned how it can be very advantageous over other available machine learning algorithm. 
- Most of all we found factors which are most important to employees and if are not fulfilled might lead to Attrition.
